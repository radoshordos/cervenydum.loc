PaperCSS was originally made by [@rhyneav](https://github.com/rhyneav) to be something different than the typical mODerN STylEs and clean pages found in every other CSS framework. It was built with LESS and deployed on a single index.html page before being open sourced. It has since evolved; The CSS source has been rewritten in SCSS and the documentation is now built with Hugo (all thanks to some [wonderful contributors](https://github.com/papercss/papercss/graphs/contributors)). In addition to the original creator, it is maintained by [@Fraham](https://github.com/Fraham) and [@TotomInc](https://github.com/TotomInc).

The goal of PaperCSS is to be as minimal as possible when adding classes. For example, a button should just look like a paper button. There shouldn't be a need to add a class such as `paper-button`. Because of this, adding PaperCSS to a markdown generated page should instantly paper-ize it.

Feel free to use it for wireframes, webapps, blogs, or whatever else you can think of! It is licensed under the [ISC License](https://github.com/papercss/papercss/blob/master/LICENSE.md), so use it wherever you want to.  

If you are new to Git or SCSS, this would be a great project to get your feet wet with. I'd be happy to help walk you through the pull request process. Check out the [Git repo](https://github.com/papercss/papercss) for more info!
